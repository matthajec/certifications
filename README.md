# Certifications
This is a list of certifications I have recieved from various online courses.

## [Scrimba Front End Developer Boot Camp](https://scrimba.com/certificate/uQmvNMCG/gfrontend)
Scrimba is an interactive platform for learning to code. The 70+ hour course goes in depth teaching front end web development. Included in the course are lessons on REST APIs, Responsive and Mobile-fist design, UI, Git version control, and React (functional and class-based components, hooks, routing, reducers, and more). 
It contains multiple challenges, including a netflix clone with authentication and a database through Google Firebase.
